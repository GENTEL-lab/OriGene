Therapeutic target discovery remains one of the most critical yet intuition-driven stages in drug development. Despite the growing availability of 
multi-omics and functional genomics data, current computational approaches lack a generalizable framework for mechanistically guided target 
nomination across disease types. Here, we present **OriGene**, a self-evolving multi-agent system that functions as a virtual disease biologist to 
identify and prioritize therapeutic targets at scale. OriGene integrates diverse agents representing functional networks, transcriptomic perturbations, 
disease ontologies, and literature-derived evidence, enabling mechanistic reasoning and scientifc hypothesis generation from heterogeneous inputs. 
To evaluate OriGene, we constructed a benchmark of over 2,000 target discovery tasks across multiple disease areas. Our results show that OriGene 
outperforms existing research agents, network- and embedding-based approaches on precision, coverage, and robustness to sparse or noisy data. Case 
studies demonstrate its ability to recover both clinically validated and previously overlooked targets. OriGene establishes a scalable framework for 
AI-assisted disease mechanism inference and therapeutic hypothesis generation.
